# Davido Stand Strong Analysis



On the 13th of May 2022, David Adeleke aka Davido announced the release of his new song “STAND STRONG” FT THE SAMPLES. With a lot of mixed feelings all over the world. We were about to see another side of the multi-talented Nigerian artist. A side we never saw, and boy David delivered on his promises with Stand Strong.

This blog is what I would call one of my favorite projects because I am writing about one of my favorite artists in Nigeria.

## Aim of Project:

The aim of this project is to understand the feelings of people who have listened to the new song Davido Stand Strong, and how well it did on social media (I.e Twitter).

And also, understanding sentiments and getting a key insight into the whole project.

## The focus of the project:

Tweet by Location.
Sentiment Score.
Top Influencers.
Tweet trend by day.
Dedicated fans.

## Requirement and Domain Knowledge:

To enjoy this article to the fullest, I recommend that you have a basic understanding of MS Excel, PowerBI, Power Automate, and Azure ML.

## Introduction:

Let’s start by introducing you to the word ‘Sentiment Analysis’ and why it is so important for companies and top influencers to know what people are saying about a certain topic or product.

Sentiment analysis is the act of computationally recognizing and categorizing opinions stated in a piece of text, especially in order to discern whether the writer has a good, negative, or neutral attitude toward a given topic, product, etc. We usually assign a positive or negative value to this sentiment, which is referred to as ‘polarity’. The sign of the polarity score is frequently used to infer whether the general emotion is positive, neutral, or negative.

I created a flow on the 12th of May, that helped me scrape data from Twitter API with anyone that mentioned the keyword #standstrong. 

Power Automate is a service that helps you create automated workflows between your favorite apps and services to synchronize files, get notifications, collect data, and more.

After scraping data from Twitter, it was then added to an Excel table, which was later used for analysis purposes.

## Tweet Trend by day starting from 12th May 2022

With the keyword #standstrong, you will see there was a decrease from the 12th of May to the 13th and subsequent days as followed.

This was also obvious in Apple music as the song never made the top spot in Lagos’ top 25 songs, but did well globally.

## Top Location of Tweet


It is obvious most users never specify the location they are tweeting from, maybe due to security reasons or so. But Lagos State being the most populous and industrial hub in Nigeria, pulled in the second-highest number of tweets by Location.

## Top Users

The top users are based on fans and if their tweet is related to the #standstrong track. These are the people who talked about the song the most, according to the data analyzed.
We made sure they weren’t spamming the trend or being bots.

## Top Influencers

The top influencers show users who were the top influencers on Twitter actually tweeting about the music. This also affected the trend of the tweet, as the increase in the number of influencers that talked about the music also increased the activities/engagements they get online.

## Davido Stand Strong Sentiment Scores

The sentiment score showed people were neutral about the music, meaning it was neither good nor bad. Meaning people describe the track with words like “acceptable” or “sufficient.

## Period of Tweet

The time period has been grouped into different sessions of the day, you will notice that most tweets or engagements happened between 20:00 hrs and 23:59 Hrs which was grouped as “Evening”.

## Most Tweeted Word

With Standstrong being the track name, had the highest intensity in the word cloud. The track enjoyed some positive comments with some key points to notice. People used the #standstrong to push for other agendas and not necessarily talk about the music itself, but, in all no negative reviews so far.

## Full Dashboard Design

## Conclusion
This project aimed to show you the capabilities of Microsoft PowerPlatform, as PowerAutomate, PowerBI, MS Excel, and Azure were used for this project.
This should encourage everyone to see the power Microsoft possesses in performing sentiment analysis and you don’t need to write long lines of code using Python.

This analysis may not be totally accurate due to the fact that only one keyword was used during web scrapping “#standstrong”, other keywords could have been used like @david, #OBO, and the rest during the time of release because all will be referring to Davido during this period.
